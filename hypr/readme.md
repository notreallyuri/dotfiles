# Hyprland Config

It works. Don't touch it unless you know what you're doing.

### Structure

- `media/` -> Media files (wallpapers and anitext).
- `hyprland/` -> Modular configs.
- `scripts/` -> Custom actions (grim, slurp, etc).
- `variables.conf` -> Colors and settings.

### Customization

For the lockscreen text, edit line 1 of `scripts/anitext.sh`.

- **Do not ask me about the defaults.**
- **Do not look too closely at the defaults.**
- Just change them.
